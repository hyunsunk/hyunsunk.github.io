`Spillover effects of media attention from nascent to established firms: the case of startups and venture capital firms in the U.S., 1968-2018`

My dissertation addresses the following question: Do positive social evaluations (e.g., reputation, celebrity) of startup firms benefit their connected venture capital firms? If so, how? Prior research studies generally frame “newness” as a liability, emphasizing newer organizations as recipients of spillover benefits from association with more established firms. In my dissertation, I explain how newness can sometimes become an asset by integrating ideas from research on spillovers and on media effects. I also explain how the media’s selection criteria—particularly its focus on novelty and drama— can lead to a pattern of highlighting startups, while typically neglecting to provide stories on venture capital firms. Drawing on judgment under uncertainty and communication theories I hypothesize and test spillover benefits generated from simple heuristics based on familiarity and fluency of information processing. I also theorize how organizational celebrity can produce distinct effects, by separating startup firms that receive sporadic attention from those celebrity startup firms that receive ongoing coverage and gain strong media presence over time.

My empirical context is the U.S. venture capital industry and startups funded by venture capital firms. Reflecting my interest in industry emergence and development, I construct a unique dataset of the media accounts of over 2,000 venture capital firms and over 26,900 venture-capital backed startups, covering the years 1968-2018. Preliminary empirical findings corroborate that media attention to startup firms translate into substantial benefits for venture capital firms through their affiliation with these startups.

Under what conditions are firms more likely to act highly inconsistently with their reputations? We identify a novel potential source for such behavior that is due to interpretive ambiguity. Specifically, we posit that ambiguity can, at times, allow firms to leverage their reputation without suffering penalties that normally attend reputation-inconsistent actions. We build this logic by using theories of social judgment, suggesting that on the one hand, audiences economize on cognitive effort by mostly assigning reputations based on salient actions that send clear and simple signals. But on the other hand, when reputation-driven expectations are violated, people switch to effortful reasoning and so discern complexities and ambiguities in the signals that unexpected actions send. As evaluators discover the ambiguity and complexity surrounding controversial decisions by the firm, they may choose not to update their reputational evaluations, opening up the possibility of firms receiving little penalty for acting in reputation- inconsistent ways. We find empirical support for our hypotheses in the setting of U.S. patent litigation in technology-intensive industries.


`Kim-Hahm, H., Lammers, JC. and Leblebici, H. From contested professional logics to hybrid organizations: the emergence of alternative litigation financing firms in the US, 1992-2019`

How does an industry emerge even when entrants face potential stigma and sharply conflicting requirements from key stakeholders? We explore this question in an historical case study of the emergence of the U.S. litigation financing industry. We examine how the language of legal professionals shape the discourse about this industry. We analyze two decades of professional legal discourse starting immediately after the legal approval of the previously illegal practice of litigation financing, using computerized textual analysis (structural topic modeling). We find there is an iterative process whereby those participating repeatedly attempt to overcome the stigma about their industry, while legal professionals outside the industry respond with restrictive rules and other sanctions in an effort to deter the potential threat to established norms. 



`Ryu, J., Kim-Hahm, H, Love, EG., and Bednar, M. Media visibility and reputational judgement`

How do the media affect reputational judgments across types of audiences? This idea originated from thinking about the puzzle posed by inconsistent findings in existing empirical studies on the media’s influence on corporate reputations. We suggest that audience reactions might differ depending on the expertise and motivation to engage in effortful reasoning. Our theory proposes that media effects are likely to vary based on characteristics of the influenced audience, rather than having a single, uniform influence.
