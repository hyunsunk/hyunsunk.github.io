`Spillover effects of media attention from nascent to established firms: the case of startups and venture capital firms in the U.S., 1968-2018`

My dissertation demonstrates how investment decisions in entrepreneurial settings are influenced by associations among organizations. I ask what benefits can be offered in the direction from nascent organizations to established organizations, while prior studies on reputation or status emphasized how established organizations may endorse nascent organizations through associations.  I argue that due to media’s selection based on journalistic criteria, established organizations may not appear much in the media, but some nascent organizations do. In my setting, I show that media coverage of startups benefits established venture capital firms through perceptual associations that the audience make. Second, it established mere recognition as an important mechanism, while prior research emphasizes strong emotions aroused by favorable coverage. I draw on communication theories that tell that news media selects what to cover, which in turn affects what people think about.

The empirical part of the data includes two comprehensive datasets: venture capital (VC) investments and the media coverage. The media coverage dataset includes over 100,000 articles of more than 36,000 venture capital-backed startups from 1945 to 2018, covered by the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and/or the Washington Post. This complete dataset allows an examination of the media’s selective attention that I theorize, by not only measuring who is covered but also measuring who is not covered. Preliminary findings point to generally supporting my theory that there are recognition-based media effects that help to promote fundraising of VC firms through their associations with startups.

My dissertation expands prior research in two meaningful ways. First, it identifies reasons why media exposure of nascent organizations can benefit established organizations through associations, whereas prior media studies focused on direct effects. Due to this effect, I suggest that media exposure of certain startups draws evaluators’ attention to those selective cases, which will make the associated established organizations more promising.
