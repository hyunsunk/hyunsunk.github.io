Spillover effects of media attention from nascent to established firms: the case of startups and venture capital firms in the U.S., 1968-2018

Do positive social evaluations (e.g., reputation, celebrity) of startup firms benefit their connected venture capital firms? If so, how? In my dissertation, I examine how newness can become an asset, by integrating ideas from research on spillover effects and research on media effects. Drawing on judgment under uncertainty and communication theories, I hypothesize and test spillover benefits generated from simple heuristics based on familiarity and fluency of information processing. I also theorize how organizational celebrity can produce distinct effects, separating startup firms that receive sporadic attention from celebrity startup firms that receive ongoing coverage and gain strong media presence over time. My empirical context is the U.S. venture capital industry and startups funded by venture capital firms. Reflecting my interest in industry emergence and development, I construct a unique dataset of media accounts of venture capital firms and their portfolio startup firms, covering the years 1968-2018.

Kim-Hahm, H. and Love, EG. Ambiguity, diagnosticity, and reputation (in)consistent actions: The case of patent litigation in the U.S., 1988-2012

Under what conditions are firms more likely to act highly inconsistently with their reputations? We identify a novel potential source for such behavior in interpretive ambiguity. Specifically, we posit that ambiguity can, at times, allow firms to leverage their reputation without suffering penalties that normally result from reputation-inconsistent actions. We build this logic by using theories of social judgment, suggesting that audiences economize on cognitive effort by assigning reputation based on salient actions that send clear and simple signals. However, when reputation-driven expectations are violated, audiences will switch to effortful reasoning to make sense of the complexities and ambiguities that unexpected actions send. As evaluators discover the ambiguity and complexity surrounding controversial decisions by the firm, they may choose not to change their reputational evaluations, opening up the possibility of firms receiving little penalty for acting in reputation-inconsistent ways. We find empirical support for our hypotheses in the setting of U.S. patent litigation in technology-intensive industries.


Kim-Hahm, H., Lammers, JC. and Leblebici, H. From contested professional logics to hybrid organizations: the emergence of alternative litigation financing firms in the US, 1992-2019

How does an industry emerge even when entrants face potential stigma and sharply conflicting requirements from key stakeholders? We explore this question in an historical case study of the emergence of the U.S. litigation financing industry. We examine how the language of legal professionals shape the discourse about this industry. We analyze two decades of professional legal discourse starting immediately after the legal approval of the previously illegal practice of litigation financing, using computerized textual analysis (structural topic modeling). We find there is an iterative process whereby those participating repeatedly attempt to overcome the stigma about their industry, while legal professionals outside the industry respond with restrictive rules and other sanctions in an effort to deter the potential threat to established norms. 


Ryu, J., Kim-Hahm, H, Love, EG., and Bednar, M. Media visibility and reputational judgement

How does the media affect reputational judgments across types of audiences? This idea originated from thinking about the puzzle posed by inconsistent findings in existing empirical studies on the mediaâ€™s influence on corporate reputations. We suggest that audience reactions may differ depending on the expertise and motivation of audiences to engage in effortful reasoning. Our theory proposes that media effects are likely to vary based on characteristics of the influenced audience, rather than having a single, uniform influence.
