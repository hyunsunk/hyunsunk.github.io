I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Theory at the Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study antecedents and consequences of social evaluations, such as corporate reputation, organizational celebrity, and approval through media. I am generally interested in how newness or unfamiliarity are accepted, rejected, or ignored by audiences. 

My dissertation examines spillover effects of media attention from an unconventional direction from nascent startups to established venture capital firms. I study settings that bear high ambiguities, where there is high outcome uncertainty, the meaning of actions is subject to interpretation, and conflicting external demands are present, such as U.S. venture capital industry, patent litigation, and alternative litigation financing. 

Prior to joining the academia, I worked as a project financial controller in Schneider Electric, Grenoble, France. As an undergraduate, I participated in restablishing a national and local committees of an international student organization AIESEC, in Accra, Ghana.
