I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Theory at the Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research is driven by a deep interest in how organizations and managers make decisions in the face of uncertainty and/or ambiguity, especially in new or unfamiliar contexts. I focus particularly on social evaluations – notably reputation and celebrity – reflecting my interest in how people perceive others and the consequences of such perceptions. 

Reflecting these research interests, I examine entrepreneurial activities, industry emergence, and patent conflicts. For example, <a href="/research/"> my dissertation </a> examines a consequence of media effects in the U.S. venture capital industry. Methodologically, I am interested in processing and analyzing large and messy datasets to examine meaningful patterns, and with using methods such as computerized content analysis. 

As a teacher, I am committed to empower students by developing their conceptual skills relevant for their success in organizations. I also work to stretch students to think effectively and innovatively as they face the messiness, lack of information, and uncertain outcomes that go with organizational decisions. My teaching approach is grounded in my research interests as well as in my practical international experiences in France, Hong Kong, and Ghana.
