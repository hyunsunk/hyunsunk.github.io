I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior/Theory at the Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The two pillars of my research are social judgment and newness. In studying social judgment, I explore reputation and media attention to understand how people perceive others and the economic consequences of such perceptions. In studying newness, I tackle the ambivalence of the excitement and illegitimacy that many new ideas and nascent organizations evoke. I take a distinctive approach to these prevailing organizational problems by focusing on the influence of attention and familiarity on issues such as venture capital fundraising and growth in nascent industries. Reflecting these research interests, <a href="/research/"> my dissertation </a> examines the way that media attention on startups can have spillover benefits for venture capital firms that invested in them. 

As a teacher, I am committed to empowering students by developing the conceptual skills to make innovative but informed decisions as they face the messiness that accompanies organizational decision making. Reflecting my teaching philosophy of learning by doing, I create hands-on experiences and engage my students through classroom activities and discussions based on real-world cases. My teaching approach is grounded in my research interests as well as in my work experience in finance and banking in France and Hong Kong.
