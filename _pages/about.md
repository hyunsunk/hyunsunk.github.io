I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Theory at the Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research is driven by a deep interest in how organizations and managers create value by making decisions in the face of uncertainty and/or ambiguity, especially in new or unfamiliar contexts. I study how people perceive others and the economic consequences of such perceptions, focusing on social evaluations, notably the effects of corporate reputation, celebrity, and stigma on venture capital funding decisions and growth in nascent industries. 

Reflecting these research interests, I study entrepreneurial activity, industry emergence, and patent conflicts. For example, <a href="/research/"> my dissertation </a> examines the consequences of media effects in the U.S. venture capital industry. Methodologically, I am interested in collecting and analyzing large and messy datasets to identify meaningful patterns, and in using methods such as automated content analysis.

As a teacher, I am committed to empowering students by developing the conceptual skills necessary for successful careers. I push students to think critically and innovatively as they face the messiness, lack of information, and uncertain outcomes that accompany organizational decision making. My teaching approach is grounded in my research interests as well as in my work experience in finance and banking in France and Hong Kong.
